# # How to use this script
#
# ## Description
#
# This script is the installer for Hipcheck. It makes sure you have the tools
# you need to do the install, downloads Hipcheck, builds it, places the
# artifacts into the appropriate directories, and tells you how to update
# your shell environment to make sure Hipcheck runs correctly.
#
# ## Input Environment Variables
#
# The following environment variables set where Hipcheck will place the
# artifacts it needs. If unset, each has a default value.
#
# - `HC_BIN`: where the `hc` binary will be placed.
# - `HC_CONFIG`: where Hipcheck's configuration files will be placed.
# - `HC_DATA`: where Hipcheck's scripts will be placed.

# Shell Configuration
#
# This makes sure we exit if anything has a non-zero exit code.
set -e

# Operating System Detection
#
# This is done with uname to remain purely POSIX-shell compliant.
# If we don't recognize the name, for now we assume Linux.

# Set Variables
#
# This handles defaulting behavior based on environment variables,
# first preferring anything explicitly set by the user, then defaulting to
# fallbacks based on the host OS otherwise.
#
# On Linux it tries to follow the XDG directory spec. On MacOS or Windows
# it defaults based on OS convention.
