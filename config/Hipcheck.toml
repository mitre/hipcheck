# Hipcheck.toml
#
# This is the config file for Hipcheck's analyses. Generally, the idea is that
# configurations should be the same between analyses of any repositories whose
# results you want to compare.
#
# Many of these configurations have a default value, and do not need to be
# included in a configuration file unless you want to override that default.

# Risk
#
# Configuration related to the overall risk tolerance across all analyses.
#==============================================================================

[risk]

# The overall threshold for risk tolerance. Anything above this threshold will
# be considered a failure. So at 0.5, if 50% of the analyses fail, that's
# considered a pass, but if more than 50% fail, that's an overall failure.
#
# Default: 0.5
threshold = 0.5
