# Hipcheck Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning].

## [3.3.0] - 2024-06-20

Hipcheck version 3.3.0 is mostly focused on refactors and internal
improvements, including a substantial refactor of the `hc` Command Line
Interface to be easier to use and easier for us to enhance in the future.
We've also continued to mature our tooling and processes around Hipcheck,
which should hopefully make future advancement easier.

## [3.2.0] - 2024-05-09

This is the first new version of Hipcheck since our initial open source
release, and it represents a lot of housekeeping to get the project up
and running! That includes:

- Getting Hipcheck compiling cleanly on the latest stable version of Rust.
- Getting all of Hipcheck's dependencies up to date.
- Shrinking Hipcheck's crate structure down to just a single binary crate.

In addition, we worked on a lot of best-practice related items, including:

- Defining RFD's (Requests for Discussion) as our means of managing the
  evolution of Hipcheck over time.
- Setting up a DevContainer configuration, for folks who'd like to contribute
  to Hipcheck without needing to set up their local environment by hand.
- Establishing Continuous Integration testing, to increase confidence in the
  correctness of future changes we may merge.
- Defining a security policy, a code of conduct, and a guide for potential
  contributors, so people know how to interact with the project.
- Defining our "Release Engineering" practices, which will help smooth out
  the flow of future releases of Hipcheck.

Up next we're planning to work on more serious redesigning of Hipcheck's
architecture to support third-party plugins for data and analysis. If that's
something that appeals to you, please let us know in the Discussions page!

Here's to the first of many more releases!
