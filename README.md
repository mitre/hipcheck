__Go from hundreds of dependencies you can't review, to just a few you can!__

Managing the security risk of third-party software at scale is difficult.
Normal projects can easily have hundreds of dependencies; far too many to
review by hand.

Hipcheck is designed to help you filter that list of dependencies down to just
a few that appear concerning, and to give you the information you need to make
a security decision quickly.

Hipcheck is a command line interface (CLI) tool for analyzing open source
software packages and source repositories to understand their software supply
chain risk. It analyzes a project's _software development practices_ and
detects _active supply chain attacks_ to give you both a long-term and
immediate picture of the risk from using a package.

## Very Quick Explanation

Hipcheck can analyze Git source repositories and open source packages from
popular package hosts.

```sh
# Analyze Express, a popular JavaScript package for web servers, with the
# URL of its Git repository.
hc check https://github.com/expressjs/express

# Analyze urllib3 version 2.2.2, a popular URL-handling package hosted on PyPI.
hc check -t pypi urllib3@2.2.2

# Analyze the package described by an SPDX Software Bill of Materials.
hc check example-sbom.spdx.json
