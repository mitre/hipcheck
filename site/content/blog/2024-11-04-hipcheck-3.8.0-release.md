Introducing Hipcheck 3.8.0, with stable support for third-party plugins, a
suite of initial plugins, and a lot of polish for the plugin user experience.

## üì¶&nbsp;&nbsp;Stable Support for Plugins

In [Hipcheck 3.6.2][hc_3_6_2], we introduced experimental support for plugins,
which add support for new data sources and analyses to Hipcheck. The goals
of the plugin system are to enable _anyone_ to expand Hipcheck's analysis
capabilities themselves and to ensure it's the best tool for users to express
and enforce their own policies for third-party&nbsp;dependencies.

Plugins in Hipcheck work by submitting queries to each other; when a plugin is
specified in a user's [policy file], Hipcheck runs that plugin's "default query,"
sending information about the target source repository and any package the user
is analyzing. Those plugins can then make queries back to Hipcheck,
which Hipcheck dispatches out to the appropriate plugin. For every query,
Hipcheck also caches the result and can reuse it for any other plugins that
need it. Even better, plugins expose JSON schemas for all queries which
Hipcheck validates, and which dependent plugins can use to ensure compatibility.

Since 3.6.2, we've been working on testing and improving the plugin system,
and on transitioning Hipcheck's existing data sources and analyses out from
the `hc` program itself and into plugins.

This transition, to make all data sources and analyses run as plugins, ensures
we gain firsthand experience with the plugin system and with our Rust plugin
SDK. During this transition we identified bugs and deficiencies in the plugin
system which have been fixed or have spurred the creation of RFDs proposing
enhancements, including:

- Chunked requests for plugin queries ([RFD&nbsp;#10][rfd_10]), to enable
  sending queries with large keys, which can arise when analyzing large Git
  repositories like the Linux kernel repository.
- Support for batch querying ([RFD&nbsp;#9][rfd_9]), to enable sending many
  small queries which are cached independently but combined in a single query
  to reduce gRPC&nbsp;overhead.

We expect to implement these RFDs in future versions of Hipcheck.

### Introducing the New Plugins

The following table lists all of the plugins added, and links to the
documentation for each plugin:

| Plugin Name           | Top-Level? | Download Manifest Location                                   |
|:----------------------|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`mitre/activity`]    | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/activity.kdl>    |
| [`mitre/affiliation`] | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/affiliation.kdl> |
| [`mitre/binary`]      | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/binary.kdl>      |
| [`mitre/churn`]       | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/churn.kdl>       |
| [`mitre/entropy`]     | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/entropy.kdl>     |
| [`mitre/fuzz`]        | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/fuzz.kdl>        |
| [`mitre/git`]         | -          | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/git.kdl>         |
| [`mitre/github`]      | -          | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/github.kdl>      |
| [`mitre/identity`]    | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/identity.kdl>    |
| [`mitre/linguist`]    | -          | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/linguist.kdl>    |
| [`mitre/npm`]         | -          | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/npm.kdl>         |
| [`mitre/review`]      | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/review.kdl>      |
| [`mitre/typo`]        | Yes        | <https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/typo.kdl>        |

The plugins listed as being "top-level" can be used directly in a policy file,
because they support a default query accepting a Hipcheck "target" to analyze.

The "download manifest locations" specify the files Hipcheck uses to determine
what artifacts to download for a plugin based on your desired version and
current architecture. You specify a `plugin` in a `plugins` block in your
policy file, like so:

```kdl
plugins {
    plugin "mitre/activity" version="0.1.0" \
        manifest="https://hipcheck.mitre.org/dl/plugin/mitre/activity.kdl"
}
```

## ü¶Ä&nbsp;&nbsp;Rust SDK version 0.2.0

This release also includes improvements for the Hipcheck Rust SDK, including:

- __New Features__
  - Plugins can now report "concerns," additional information to inform a
    Hipcheck user what to inspect if they want to further investigate
    a target&nbsp;([#511](https://github.com/mitre/hipcheck/pull/511))
  - Reduced the size of compiled code from the SDK using non-generic inner
    functions&nbsp;([#488](https://github.com/mitre/hipcheck/pull/488))
  - Added ability for plugin test code to mock query
    responses&nbsp;([#476](https://github.com/mitre/hipcheck/pull/476))

- __Bugfixes__
  - Fixed bugs with query chunking which could result in errors when analyzing
    large
    repositories&nbsp;([#630](https://github.com/mitre/hipcheck/pull/630))
  - Fixed bug that resulted in duplicate reporting of query explanations for
    the default query of a
    plugin&nbsp;([#605](https://github.com/mitre/hipcheck/pull/605))
  - Fixed bug that caused failing queries to not send errors over gRPC back to
    Hipcheck core&nbsp;([#548](https://github.com/mitre/hipcheck/pull/548))

## üó∫Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Get Involved

Hipcheck is an open source project, and we'd love to get more contributors
involved in building it. This doesn't just mean contributing to `hc` itself
or building plugins, but also contributing to the website, improving the
documentation, asking questions and sharing ideas in the issue tracker
and discussions forum, and writing about your own experiences and lessons
with Hipcheck for others to read.

We have big plans for version 3.9.0 and beyond, including:

- __Version 3.9.0__
  - Query Batching and Submit Chunking
  - Integrating plugins with the `hc ready` command
- __Version 3.10.0__
  - Substantial plugin documentation improvements, especially for creating your
    own plugins
  - Refactoring target resolution to make it easier to add support for more
    types of targets, like more SBOM formats or package hosts
- __Version 3.11.0__
  - Explainable policy expressions, improving reporting of failed analyses by
    explaining policy expressions in plain language
  - Overhaul result reporting to make it easier to improve in the future, and
    improve parity between the human-readable and JSON formats
  - Upgrade `salsa`, the Rust package we use internally for query caching, to
    the latest major version
  - Introduce new documentation on how to become a Hipcheck developer yourself
