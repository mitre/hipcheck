Introducing Hipcheck 3.9.0, with bugfixes for plugin downloading and a new Git
commit and diff parser.

## üí¨&nbsp;&nbsp;A New Git Commit and Diff Parser

One of the key jobs that the `mitre/git` plugin for Hipcheck needs to do is
parse Git commits and diffs. This plugin, which is a dependency of several
other plugins we ship today, previously used a hand-rolled parser built using
[`nom`], a popular Rust library for writing parser combinators. This had been
tested against a wide array of open source Git repositories to identify and
fix bugs, but of course for a parser working with something as flexible as the
Git commit and diff format, there were still more to find. Over time, we'd
identified this parser as a priority for replacement. It just didn't make sense
to continue investing effort toward improving our own parser when others, more
battle-tested, exist out in the world.

In this release, we've transitioned from our hand-rolled parser to the one
implemented by the [Gitoxide] project. Gitoxide is a project to reimplement Git
in Rust, and their [`gix`] crate includes a Git commit and diff parser that
works better than the one we'd written. In the short term, it's also slightly
slower, though we believe in prioritizing correctness first, and we can work on
improving its performance in the future.

With this new parser in place, we expect fewer Git parsing bugs in the future,
and therefore more successful analyses of Git repository histories!

## üì¶&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved Plugin Downloading

One of the key tasks Hipcheck does before it starts analyses is to resolve the
set of plugins requested by the user in their policy file, and all the
dependencies of those plugins. To do this, it downloads the plugin artifacts
for the requested version and the current architecture based on each plugin's
download manifest, placing them in a local plugin cache.

In 3.9.0, we've made two improvements to this process. First, we ensure we
delete unused materials after copying out the stuff we need to run a plugin.
Second, we ensure that we skip downloading plugins which already exist in the
cache. This means less work over the network, and a faster plugin execution
time when you reuse a policy you've run before.

## üëÄ&nbsp;&nbsp;What's in the Release?

| Package             | What is it? | New Version |
|:--------------------|:------------|:------------|
| `hc`                | Hipcheck    | 3.9.0       |
| `mitre/git`         | Plugin      | 0.2.0       |
| `mitre/activity`    | Plugin      | 0.2.0       |
| `mitre/affiliation` | Plugin      | 0.2.0       |
| `mitre/churn`       | Plugin      | 0.2.0       |
| `mitre/entropy`     | Plugin      | 0.2.0       |
| `mitre/identity`    | Plugin      | 0.2.0       |

The non-`mitre/git` plugins were bumped because they depend on `mitre/git` and
are now using the new version.

## ü´∏&nbsp;&nbsp;Things Pushed to Later Releases

We've hoped land the implementations for [RFD #9] and [RFD #10] in 3.9.0, but
they're not ready yet, and so we're pushing them to the 3.10.0 release.

We're also still working on integrating plugins into the `hc ready` command, to
ensure it provides clearer and more accurate feedback indicating when Hipcheck
is ready to&nbsp;run.
