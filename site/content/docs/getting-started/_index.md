# Getting Started

Hello, and welcome! This is a "Quickstart" guide to Hipcheck, which means our
goal with this guide is to get you up and running as a user of Hipcheck as
quickly as possible. If you'd like a more thorough guide to Hipcheck which
explains its core concepts, how it works under the hood, and how to configure
it to your heart's content, we recommend the [Complete Guide](@/docs/guide/_index.md).
