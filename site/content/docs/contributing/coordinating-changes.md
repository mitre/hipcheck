# Coordinating Changes

For small changes, including improvements to documentation, correction of
bugs, fixing typos, and general code quality improvements, submitting
without coordinating with the Hipcheck team is generally fine and
appreciated!

For larger changes, including the addition of new data sources, new analyses,
refactoring modules, changing the CLI or configuration, or similar, we
highly suggest discussing your proposed changes before submission. Often
this will begin with opening up a GitHub Issue or a Discussion, and for
larger changes may also involve writing a Request for Discussion (RFD)
document.

RFD's are how the Hipcheck project manages large scale changes to the tool,
and are documented more on the RFD's page.

The Hipcheck product roadmap is public, and we always recommend checking
there to see how your proposed changes may fit into the currently-planned
work.
