# Describing Changes

All commits to Hipcheck are required to follow the Conventional Commits
specfication. We use this requirement to help us auto-generate material
for our `CHANGELOG.md` and GitHub Release notes with each new version,
though we do still double-check and write them by hand.

We also generally try to make sure commits serve a reasonably clear
purpose, and include comments whenever appropriate to explain the
reasoning behind what is being changed, or at least link to a GitHub
Issue or Discussion for further explanation.
