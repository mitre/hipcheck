# RFDs

RFDs are Hipcheck's mechanism for managing major changes to the tool.
The motivation and details of the process are described in [RFD #0,
"The RFD Process."](/rfds/0000)

Anyone can submit an RFD! If you're interested in contributing to Hipcheck's
design, take a look at the [Contribution Guide](/contribute).
